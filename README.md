# README
Due to the success of the first game, many have visited the cave in which many treasures dwell.

You, as a daring adventurer, have discovered a cave in your hometown, strangely near a building that seems to be unused.

I will be your eyes and hands. Direct me with commands of one or two words. I should warn you that I only look at the first five letters of each word, so if you'll have to enter "Northeast" as "ne" to distinguish it from "North". (Should you get stuck, type "help" or "info" for some general hints.)
