To move, try words like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south, up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer the object from the verb alone. 
Some objects also imply verbs; in particular, "inventory" implies "take inventory", which causes me to give you a list of what you're carrying.  Some objects have unexpected effects; the effects are not always desirable!  Usually people having trouble moving just need to try a few more words. 
Usually people trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely different tack. One point often confusing to beginners is that, when there are several ways to go in a certain direction (e.g., if there are several holes in a wall), choosing that direction in effect chooses one of the ways at random; often, though, by specifying the place you want to reach you can guarantee choosing the right path.
