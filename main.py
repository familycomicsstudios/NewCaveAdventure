To move, try words like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south, up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer the object from the verb alone. 
Some objects also imply verbs; in particular, "inventory" implies "take inventory", which causes me to give you a list of what you're carrying.  Some objects have unexpected effects; the effects are not always desirable!  Usually people having trouble moving just need to try a few more words. 
Usually people trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely different tack. One point often confusing to beginners is that, when there are several ways to go in a certain direction (e.g., if there are several holes in a wall), choosing that direction in effect chooses one of the ways at random; often, though, by specifying the place you want to reach you can guarantee choosing the right path. Good luck, and have fun!""",

There are also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and there are other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, just keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you haven't found them all yet.
